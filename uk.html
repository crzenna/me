		<p>I arrived in Edinbrugh during the Fringe festival. The streets were very busy and it has been hard finding accommodation</p>
		<p>I didn't arrived very organized and I ended up switching between three different hostels</p>
		<p>At some point I found an apartment to stay and started studying at the Merchiston campus of Edinburgh Napier University.</p>

		<h2>Work</h2>
		<p>When I first arrived I decided to go around the city and hand out my resumes to some hotels that were looking part time receptionists</p>
		<p>I got hired the following week I arrived and started working at YOTEL Edinburgh every friday, staurday and sundau for a total of twenty hours per week</p>
		<p>In this way I was able to afford my rent without having to ask additional money to my parents, and the fact that the hotel took me time only during weekends made possible that I could organise my studies and class attendancies.</p>
