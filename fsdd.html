		<h1>Foundations of software design and development</h1>
		<h2>Year 1 module</h2>
		<h3>Module description</h3>
		<p>TThis is an introduction to software development, of which the module assumes no prior experience. Students will develop, run and debug programs. The first half of the module focuses on the foundational algorithmic constructs of sequence, selection, and iteration, through the use of flowcharts/pseudocode and their implementation in the Java language. Fundamental data structures such as arrays are introduced. Students are introduced to the idea of choosing a data structure appropriate for purpose. The second half of the module introduces the principles of object-oriented software development, including objects, classes, properties, methods, and inheritance. Best practice is covered throughout the module, including strategies to make code readable, and to facilitate code reuse.</p>
