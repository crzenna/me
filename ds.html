		<h1>Database systems</h1>
		<h2>Year 2 module</h2>
		<h3>Module description</h3>
		<p>The module covers these aspects of databases:</p>

<p>Database theory: The relational model is a mathematical construct, and some of the basic concepts can be very useful in understanding the way the technology behaves. This is particularly true for the more technical students who go on to study data warehouses and data mining. Basic set theory and the ANSI-SPARC three level architectural model are covered in this part.</p>

<p>Database design: A key skill for software engineers and for business analysts is to be able to create an efficient relational model of an application context. The design methods specific to relational databases including entity-relationship diagrams and normalisation are covered here.</p>

<p>Database use: The most fundamental database skill is to be able to retrieve required data using well-designed queries. The main vehicle for this is SQL, and this theme is developed over all teaching weeks. As well as learning SQL in isolation using online teaching materials, you will also have access to a stand-alone database application where you can construct your own schema and design and perform your own SQL queries. As part of this theme, other uses of SQL will be introduced which demonstrate its relationship with programming and Web application design.</p>

<p>Database administration: The database administrator (DBA) is a vital role in any information technology department. Some of the main DBA responsibilities will be examined as part of this theme, and you will carry out basic administrative tasks such as backing up and restoring databases. The use of scripts to automate database management processes will also be covered.</p>
