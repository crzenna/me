		<h2>Three thingsh that defines me</h2>
		<p>When I think about my passions and hobby it is not easy to come up with a straight answer.<br>
		I have never been a sporty guy, I only did a bit of swimming when I was 6 but nothing so serious, and I did not persue this passion, if passion we can call it.</p>

		<p>However, the first three things that pop into my mind whenever someone asks me to say three things that defines me are probably travelling, architecture and music.</p>
