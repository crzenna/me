		<h2>When I was little</h2>
		<p>I was born on July 9th 1998 in Venice city.</p>
		<p>My brother also was born on July 9th but two years earlier than me. It semms fair saying that I came as a gift for his second birthday.</p>
		<p>In Italy at the age of 3 your parents can decide if you should go to nursery school or remain at home until you're six and start Elementary school.<br>
		My parents decided I had to go to nursery school and I still have a lot of vivid memories about that period, despite my young age.<br>
		I remeber how good was running in the little nursery park racing with friends, and good the food used to be there.</p>
		<p>Pellestrina, the island where I lived and still live at the moment, is a very small island. We're just three-thousand people living here and we all know each other. The kids who were born in 1998 were just 34, and it is nusery school where we met for three years, before spending together eight more between elementary and middle school.</p>

		<h2>Elementary school</h2>
		<p>With those same people, I started Elementary school.</p>
		<p>The memories I have about Elementary school and my childhood are all very happy ones.<br>
		I have always considered living here a luck. The fact that we were just few people attending school made possible to have stronger and closer relationship between each ohter. It was possible for us to know each other deeply by spending a lot of time together.</p>
		<p>During the day we were spending eight hours together, and the we would meet in the afternoon and play together, or attend church or some other organized recreating activities.</p>
		<p>I have always been a very creative kid, and I remember Art being my favorite subject during this years. We would always prepare some little work of art for each festivity and bring them home as a gift for our familiies. And I remember those as the happiest moments at school, were we would get all dirty and creative little artists.</p>

		<h2>Middle school</h2>
		<p>Middle school was just few hundreds of meters away from the elementary school building. Once again, same people.</p>
		<p>Middle school preceeds High school in Italy, it is when you start understading what you're passionate about and what you would like to become in the future. It is during the third year of middle school that you must decide if the next five years of your life are going to me about Literature and History, Math and Sciences, Phsychology, Languages, Mechanics or practical work such as hairdressing or beauty service.</p>
		<p>I went for Languages, and applied to study Tourism and Economics in Venice city - about one hour and a half with public transportation from Pellestrina.</p>
		<h2>High school</h2>
		<p>High school years are definitely the best years of my life. I had the chance to meet new people, people coming not just from my island but from all over Venice and the other islands.</p>
		<p>I was also lucky enough to attend these five years of high school with my best friend, reason why today we still laugh about all the happy moments we lived together.</p>
		<p>My studies were focused on Toursim, therefore we studies how hotels and travel agencies work. We also had the possibility to experience the work environment through a one-month work experience in a hotel, during school time.<br>
		This resulted to be interesting to me, reason why after I graduated High school the first job I applied to was as Receptionist in a hotel located in the city centre of Venice.</p>

		<h2>Departure to Australia</h2>
		<p>After working for four months at the hotel I wanted to try something new and different and challenging: applying for a one year Visa to Australia, where I would have been able to work and travel and meet people all over the world.</p>
		<p>After a long conversation with my parents, I decided to go for it, and on December 12th 2017 my plane was taking off from Venice directed to Dubai and then Sydney.</p>
		<p>I knew Australia was the land of possibility and a dreamland where everything could happen, but I would have neveer thought that my experience in Australia would have been THAT good.</p>
