		<h1>About me</h1>
		<p>Hello,<br><br>
			My name is Cristian and I am 23 years old.<br>
			I was born in Venice and raised in Pellestrina, which is a small island in the Venetian lagoon<br>
		</p>
		<p>After attending elementary and middle school in Pellestrina, I decided to study Toursim and Economics at the Francesco Algarotti Institute in Venice city, where I had the chance to learn English, Spanish and French.
		</p>
		<p>After finishing High school, I worked for few months in a Hotel, so that I could get some professional experience before leaving Europe and moving to Australia, where I ended up spending almost two years of my life.</p>
		<p>Once I decided that it was time for my Australian experience to end, I moved to Edinburgh in the UK where I started studying at the Edinburgh Napier University.</p>
