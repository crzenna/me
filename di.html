		<h1>Digital Imaging</h1>
		<h2>Year 1 module</h2>
		<h3>Module description</h3>
		<p>This module puts the theory and principles underpinning digital imaging into practice, nurturing your creative confidence through a practical, learner-focused approach. The interactive lectures are designed to make the theoretical components of the module relevant through creative examples and exploring the important role of visual media in society. The technical aspects are made understandable through hands-on learning and made relevant by exploring case studies on visual practitioners and exploring a review of the state of the art in digital imaging.</p>

		<p>The module is assessed through creative coursework and the continuous development of a digital sketchbook. These provide plenty of opportunities for formative feedback from the tutor and peers during the practical sessions, as well as a reflexive learning log for your continued journey on the programme.</p>
