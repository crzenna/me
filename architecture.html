		<h2>Is it really a passion?</h2>
		<p>I am not one hudred percent sure if I should consider Architecture as a passion of mine.<br>
		I just know that when I go around and visit some place new, I am super affascinated by buildings and structures and, in general, the architecture.</p>
		<p>I love how different architects have their own style, and how recognisable architectural styles can be</p>
		<p>One of my favorite architect and architecture studio is Zaha Hadid and ZHA (Zaha Hadid Architects). I simply love how instantly recognizable their works are, and how well they fit into a landscape or in a neighboorhood.</p>

		<h2>Instagram</h2>
		<p>I did not study architecture, I do not have any technical foundations abut it. I just love the way it looks.<br>
			For this reason, I created an <a href="https://instagram.com/crzenna.svg"> Instagram profile</a> where I take what I think are interesting architectural alements, and turn them into graphic design element, turning them into icons/logos. And I think we can consider it as a passion of mine, digitally recreating architectural elements.</p>
