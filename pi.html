		<h1>Playful interaction</h1>
		<h2>Year 2 module</h2>
		<h3>Module description</h3>
		<p>As the sociologist Huizinga has observed, play pre-dates culture, pre-dates civilisation. It is something we unambiguously share with many animals. Easily and mistakenly dismissed as an empty activity, play and playfulness underpin language, many forms of knowing, poetry, literature and many aspects of ‘new media’, and they may provide a conceptual basis for the next generation of interactive technology. This module will comprise a wide ranging review of the role of play and playfulness from psychological, sociological, narratological and technological perspectives.</p>
