		<h2>No, I do not sing</h2>
		<p>Since I was young I have always loved to sing in my bedroom, pretenting a big crowd of people was watching me. I did not just sing. I performed.</p>
		<p>Sometimes me and my brother we still laugh at how confident I was while performing and singing in Italian, English, and Spanish, most of the time making up words just to go with the music.</p>
		<p>I have never attended singing classes, I've never been interested in learning how to sing well.</p>
		<p>I don't think I was any good at it, I just loved doing it. Now I stopped, I dont perform or sing in my bedroom anymore. Someone might get in. Therefore I do it in the shower, no chance of someone breaking in while I'm encouragin the audience to sing with me.</p>
		<p>While in public I just limit myself listening to music. A lot</p>

		<p>But I do listen</p>
	<p>Music has always been part of my life. I attended 8 concerts of the same singer. It happened I attended the same concert twice in a week.</p>
	<p>There are some songs that accompanied me during my whole, while going to school, sharing headphones with my best friend, while travelling, while being alone at home</p>
	<p>I honestly believe that people need music to be happy, I wouldn't be able to imagine my life with no music, so for this reason I decided to include Music as a passion in this presentation of me.</p>
	<p>I might not be good at singing, but if we'll never have a conversation I might be good in giving you advice on what to listen during a flight, during a happy day, during a sad day, during a rough day, or during a breakup</p>
