		<h1>Australia</h1>

		<h2>Work</h2>
		<p>I was able to find a position as hotel receptionist during my first week in Sydney. I stayed in a hostel for the first ten days and then I moved to a shared apartment close to the place I was working. The working holiday visa (WHV) allows you to work for the same employes just for six months. For this reason, I got another job as receptionist in a different hotel starting on August 2018. I stayed there until the end of my stay in Australia. I never came back to Italy during the whole period abroad, and despite the fact that I missed my friends and family, I never wished to be elsewhere. In Australia I was happy.</p>

		<h2>People</h2>
		<p>I was surrounded by amazing people coming from all over the world.</p>
		<p>Most of my time I was with Spanish people, with which I enjoyed many many barbecues by the ocean and crazy parties and festival.</p>
		<p>The best part of my Australian experience was meeting people, exchanging ideas and information and travel tips and life tips.</p>

		<h2>Travels</h2>
		<p>During my 18 months of Australia I have been lucky enough to visit a lot of interesting places around the country and outside as well.</p>
		<p>I travelled around Melbourne, Brisbane, Goldcoast, Byron Bay, Alice Springs, but also Bali in Indonesia, Singapore, Bangkok and Phucket in Thailand, and Manila and Palawan in the Philippines.</p>
		<p>I love travelling, and Australia is in a very strategic position to do so.<br>
		The only thing I'm sorry for is not having had the chance to visit New Zeland!</p>

		<h2>Studies</h2>
		<p>Once my one year Visa expired I had two options: I could either go back home, or extend my stay by enrolling in a course and ask for a student visa.</p>
		<p>Of course that's what I did</p>
		<p>I enrolled in a 6 months Economics course and kept working part time enjoying the crazy weekends and memorable festival.</p>
		<p>One day once I realised that I did not have enough time left there, I found myself sitting on the sofa and planning what would have been my next adventure in life: I applied to study at University in Edinburgh, UK.</p>
		<p>I got accepted and after going back to Italy for two weeks I packed my suitcase again and flew to the <a href="uk.html">UK</a></p>
