		<h1>Travelling</h1>

		<h2>Europe</h2>
		<p>My family in general and my parents always loved travelling.<br>
			I was very lucky I started travelling since a very young age. Every winter my family and I would go to somewhere warm. I visited the Canary Island, going to Tenerife, Gran Canaria and twice to Lanzarote. Growing up I then travelled to Barcelona where I celebrate New Year's day with my friends and had the best time ever.</p>
			<p>
			Since I was studying Tourism and hospitality with languages, my school offered every summer a two week trip of a studied language, for this reason I went to France, visiting Lion, Grenoble, Annency; to Spain visitng Valencia; and to Ireland vsiting Dublin.</p>
			<p>During the last year of highschool, we also went four days in Berlin, Germany, and four days to London, UK. I remember those days vividly and happily</p>
			<p>I recently visited a friend of mine who is living in Denmark, so I spent four days in Copenhagen which I absolutely loved it.</p>
			<p>Of course I also visited a bit of Scotland during the last part of my life when I have been living in the <a href="uk.html">United Kingdom</a></p>

		<h2>South America</h2>
		<p>The only place I visited in South America is Natal, which is a small but very nice city on the North of Brazil.<br>
			Me, my parents and my brother we spent there 15 days during the Christmans and NYE holidays, celebrating at the beach with a very warm weather.<br>
		Despite the fact that I was very little, I remember that trip and I wish my parents had taken more photos of it</p>
		<p>Cutlurally speaking I love South America and I really hope I will get the chance to go back there very soon</p>

		<h2>Oceania</h2>
		<p>During my eighteen months of <a href="australia.html">Australia</a> I had the chance to visit amazing places which I will always keep inside my heart.<br>
			Visitng Australia as a traveller is something I recommend to everyone.</p>
			<p>I visited Sydney, Melbourne, Gold Coast, Byron Bay and the Outback, and other small towns in New South Wales</p>
			<p>Unfortunately I did nto get the chance to visit the Western part of Australia and New Zeland, but there is no rush as I am sure one day I will definitely go back</p>

		<h2>South-East Asia</h2>
		<p>During my experience in <a href="australia.html">Australia</a> I decided to meet with my brother and travel together for a month<br>
		During this month we went to Singapore, Bangkok, Phuket, Palawan and Manila.</p>
		<p>I extremely loved the Philippines, the water was crystal clear and there were not a lot of tourists, it was very peaceful</p>
		<p>Thailand was great but not as much as the Philippines in my opinion. It was crowded with tourists and the ocean was not as clear as the one in Palawan.</p>
		<p>Singapore was amazing. We spent one night in the famous hotel Marina Bay Sands where we could enjoy the view of the city from the Rooftop infinite pool, an experience difficul to forget<br>
		I also went to Bali, but this time not with my brother. I went there by myself and met with people coming from all over the world, mostly UK or Australia.</p>
		Bali was very nice, but super crowded with tourists. I spent 4 days in Gili T island, and it was probably one of the most incredible and peaceful places I have ever been to. One hundred percent recommended</p>
